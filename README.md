# Coinkite Tap Protocol and Helper Program

This python library will make it easy to talk to the TAPSIGNER and SATSCARD.

This repo includes:

1. The protocol specification
2. Python library for speaking the protocol
3. (maybe) Examples/libraries in other languages

# Protocol Spec

See files in <./docs>.

# Install

This is the python code and command-line utilities you need to communicate with it over USB.

## Setup For Everyday Use

- `pip install 'coinkite-tap-proto[cli]'`

This installs a single helpful command line program: `cktap`

If you just want the python library, use:

- `pip install coinkite-tap-proto`


## Setup If You Might Change the Code

- do a git checkout
- probably make a fresh virtual env
- run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --editable '.[cli]'
```

## Requirements

- python 3.6 or higher
- `pyscard` for acceess to smartcard readers
- a supported smart-card reader:
    - "ACS ACR1252U" is better and also available.
    - "Identiv uTrust 3700F" is reliable and looks nice
    - "ACS ACR122U" can work, and is widely available, but is not recommended!
    - but most smartcard USB class-compliant devices should work.
- see `requirements.txt` file for more details.

## Windows Notes

- to install pyscard, I needed swig installed:
    - download zip from <http://swig.org>
    - extract, move into `C:\Program Files`
    - add that to sysmte PATH
    - test: `swig` at command prompt should work
    - then `pip install pyscard` worked

# Using the Library

```python
from cktap.transport import CKTapCard
card = CKTapCard.find_first()
print(card.address())
```

# Using the CLI

## Providing CVC

Any command which reveals private key info or changes the
state of the card will require the 6-digit numeric code
from the back of the code (called CVC or "spend code"). You can
provide this on the command line, or omit it. If required, you
will be prompted for the CVC. Some commands will display
what information they can without the CVC. To see more, add the code
on the command line

## Most Useful Commands

`cktap open` 
- opens Bitcoin Core or your other wallet, by activating the BITCOIN:addr 
URL scheme for the curent slot of the card.

`cktap qr` 
- displays QR code for deposit

`cktap unseal`
- unseals the current slot and shows the WIF for funds sweaping
- you will require a blockchain-aware wallet to import that WIF into

## Examples
