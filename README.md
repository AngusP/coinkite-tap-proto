# Coinkite Tap Protocol and Helper Program

This python library will make it easy to talk to the TAPSIGNER and SATSCARD.

This repo includes:

1. The protocol specification
2. Python library for speaking the protocol
3. (someday) Examples/libraries in other languages

# Full Documentation

[Protocol spec](docs/protocol.md) is now public!

Related documentation can be found in [docs subdir](docs).

[Coinkite-tap-proto source code](https://github.com/coinkite/coinkite-tap-proto)

# Install

This is the python code and command-line utilities you need to communicate with it over USB.

## Setup For Everyday Use

- `pip install 'coinkite-tap-proto[cli]'`

This installs a single helpful command line program: `cktap`

If you just want the python library, use:

- `pip install coinkite-tap-proto`


## Setup If You Might Change the Code

- do a git checkout
- probably make a fresh virtual env
- run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install --editable '.[cli]'
```

## Requirements

- python 3.6 or higher
- `pyscard` for access to smartcard readers
- a supported smart-card reader:
    - "ACS ACR1252U" is okay and widely available.
    - "Identiv uTrust 3700F" is reliable and looks nice
    - HID Omnikey 5022 CL (not 5021) is fast, cute and small.
    - "ACS ACR122U" can work, and is widely available, but is not reliable nor recommended!
    - in theory, all smartcard USB CCID class-compliant devices should work.
- see `requirements.txt` file for more details.

## Windows Notes

- to install pyscard, I needed swig installed:
    - download zip from <http://swig.org>
    - extract, move into `C:\Program Files`
    - add that to system PATH
    - test: `swig` at command prompt should work
    - then `pip install pyscard` worked

## FreeBSD Notes

- tested against 13.0-RELEASE
- need `pkg install py38-pyscard py38-coincurve` 
    - follow devfs.conf instructions
    - install usr/ports/devel/libccid
    - add `pcscd_enable="YES"` to rc.conf
- `pip install base58`
- `pip install -e git+https://github.com/coinkite/python-bip32.git@iss27#egg=bip32`
- make your virtualenv with: `virtualenv ENV --system-site-packages`
- need `pkg install py38-secp256k1` (which pulls a tragic set of dependencies)
- MAYBE: 'swig' is needed to build wheel for `pyscard`, so `pkg install swig`?

# Using the Library

```python
>>> from cktap import find_first
>>> card = find_first()
>>> print(card)
<CKTapCard SATSCARD: 26NKY-RWPK4-65YR7-BU4WL> 
>>> card.address()
'bc1q7h0u5yn8y4pajn94ze4gnhz487c8ysvekusqj5'
```

# Using the CLI

## Providing CVC

Any command which reveals private key info or changes the state of
the card will require the 6-digit numeric code from the back of the
card (called CVC or "spend code", or "Starting PIN Code" on TAPSIGNER).
You can provide this on the command line, or omit it. When required,
you will be prompted for the CVC if it wasn't on the command line.
Some commands will display what information they can without the
CVC. In those cases, to see more detail, add the CVC on the command line.

## Most Useful Commands

### SATSCARD

`cktap open` 
- opens Bitcoin Core or your other wallet, by activating the BITCOIN:addr 
URL scheme for the current slot of the card.

`cktap qr` 
- displays QR code for deposit

`cktap unseal`
- unseals the current slot and shows the WIF for funds sweeping
- you will require a blockchain-aware wallet to import that WIF into

`cktap balance`
- calls a webservice to get UTXO and show current Bitcoin balance
- if you have `tord` already running locally, it will be used to proxy the request

### TAPSIGNER

`cktap status`
- show info about state

`cktap setup`
- causes card to pick private key (call once)

`cktap xpub`
- show the XPUB in effect

`cktap backup`
- save card's XPRV into AES-128-CTR encrypted file with today's date

`cktap change OLDPINCODE NEWPINCODE`
- change the PIN on the card

`cktap path`
- show the derivation path in effect, by default: `m/84h/0h/0h`
