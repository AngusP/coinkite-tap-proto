# Changes Between Versions of Card Applet

The "applet" reports a version number in the status field (`ver`) as a short string.

This document explains differences between versions.

## 1.0.3 - September 2022

- Enhancement: SATSCARD's unsealed slots, when 'dump' command is used, will share
  compressed pubkey in addition to address.


## 1.0.2 - Mid July 2022

- Bugfix: too-short or too-long CVC codes did not count towards
  "bad CVC" counter when they were attempted, so 15 second delay was
  never enforced for those cases. This effectively leaks the length
  of the CVC on the TAPSIGNER. On SATSCARD the CVC length is always six.

## 1.0.1 - Early July 2022

- Enhancement: non-numeric PIN (CVC) codes are rejected as new values
  to the "change PIN" command. All CVC codes must be 6 to 32 digits of 0..9.

- Very minor bug fix, affecting only TAPSIGNER with specific arguments
  to "change" command.

## 1.0.0 - Early July 2022

- Enhancement (breaking change---sorry): SATSCARD during certificate
  check (`check` command) will now attest to the public key of the
  current slot if the slot is sealed.  As a result, when verifying
  the factory certificate on a SATSCARD with a sealed slot, you will
  need to fetch the pubkey of the current slot in order to verify the
  factory certificate. Change does not apply to TAPSIGNER, SATSCHIP
  or a SATSCARD where the current slot is unsealed or unused.

- Bugfix: In some situations, a new `card_nonce` was picked, and
  not reported to the caller because an error code (unrelated) was
  being reported.  This required an extra call to `status` command
  to recover (to learn the updated nonce). In most cases this was
  harmless because only error paths had this issue. However, during
  the `sign` command, a valid request can fail due to bad luck
  (205: unlucky number), and it's easier if we could re-try the verbatim
  command immediately with no extra steps. In version 1.0.0 and later,
  the `card_nonce` will only be updated if the new value is provided
  in a reponse. No change is required to operate with this version,
  but efficiencies can be had if considered.

- Bugfix: Invalid arguments to a specific command could
  set the tampered flag and brick the SATSCARD. Fixed.

- Bugfix: The 'certs' command included the `card_nonce` but that
  was not called for in the protocol spec, and isn't needed. Removed.

- Bugfix: Nonce values provided have to be "non weak", meaning that
  all bytes cannot be the same. The code that checks this on the card
  had a bug and would reject as "weak" some cases that do satify the
  requirement. Very slim odds of hitting this bug if you pick nonces
  randomly.

- SATSCHIP model: this product variant is a TAPSIGNER in all respects,
  except, as of v1.0.0: `num_backups` in status field is omitted, and
  a flag `satschip=True` will be present instead. The "backup" command
  is not supported and will fail with 404 error.

## 0.9.0 - March 2022

- First public version.
